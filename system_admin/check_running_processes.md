# System Admin linux commands

Display all processes running on the system:
```
ps
```

Find all processes running with java: 
```
ps aux | grep java
```


Kill a process:
```
pkill
```

# Will Chows advise: 

```
# tells you process running in the background
ps aux | less
/<search_term> 

# see if the process is running + how much cpu and memory is being used
top 
# type "1" into the top display ... and this will show you what's happening on all the cpus
```
